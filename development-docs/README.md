## Process overview

Welcome! We're glad you're here. We're about to give you an overview of what we need to do to add cmdlets to the Entra PowerShell module. This guide aims to ensure consistency and provide a better experience for customers. Here is an overview of the process.

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Get Started    | Familiarize yourself with [cmdlets](./design-guidelines/cmdlet-best-practices.md), modules, [parameters](./design-guidelines/parameter-best-practices.md), [piping](./design-guidelines/piping-best-practices.md) best practices, key concepts, naming conventions, testing, review processes, and other best practice guidelines. |
| Implementation | [Set up the environment], develop cmdlet logic, create unit tests, and document cmdlets with examples.                                                                                                                            |
| Review         | Submit changes by raising a pull request for review by the community and the Microsoft Entra PowerShell Engineering team.                                                                                                       |
| Publish        | We deploy approved changes in the next release train.                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites should be completed before contributing to the Entra PowerShell repository:

- Install [Visual Studio code][vscode]
- Install the latest version of [Git][git-download]
- Install the [`platyPS` module](help-generation.md#Installing-platyPS)
- Install [PSScriptAnalyzer][script-analyzer]
- Install [PowerShell 7][powershell7]
- Set the PowerShell [execution policy][set-execution-policy] to **Unrestricted** for the following versions of PowerShell:
  - `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
  - `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
  - `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\{{version}}\pwsh.exe`

## Environment Setup

### GitHub Basics

If you don't have experience with Git and GitHub, some of the terminology and process can be confusing. [Here is a guide to understanding the GitHub flow][git-workflow] and [here is a guide to understanding the basic Git commands][git-cheat-sheet].

To develop in the Entra PowerShell repository locally, you first need to create your own fork. For more information on how to fork, click [here][git-forking].

Once your fork of the Entra PowerShell repository has been created, you need to clone your fork to your local machine. To do so, run the following command:

```git
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/entra-powershell.git
```

You now be able to create your own branches, commit changes, and push commits to your fork.

**Note**: we recommend adding the _microsoftgraph/entra-powershell_ repository to your list of tracked repositories in Git. This allows you to easily pull changes from the `microsoftgraph/entra-powershell` repository. To do this, run the following command:

```git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoftgraph/entra-powershell.git
```

Then, to pull changes from the **main** branch in _microsoftgraph/entra-powershell_ into your local working branch, run the following command:

```git
git pull upstream main
```

## Creating Cmdlets

### PowerShell Cmdlet Design Guidelines

Please check out the [_Cmdlet Best Practices_](./design-guidelines/cmdlet-best-practices.md) document for more information on how to create cmdlets that follow the PowerShell guidelines.
